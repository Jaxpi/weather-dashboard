## Description

This application was created for travelers to use in order to quickly and easily see the current and near-future weather conditions for cities around the world so they can plan properly for their trip. Users can type in a city name and submit which will bring up the current temperature, weather, wind speed, and humidity of the location as well as the same conditions for the following 5 days.

## Usage

Users type in the city name in the form box beneath "Search for a City." Upon pressing enter or clicking the saerch button the weather information will be displayed. That city will be added to the list of recent cities so the user can simply click on the city name there to see the weather if they refresh the page or close it and want to check again at a later time. If the user wishes to view this application on their phone or tablet the page layout will adapt dynamically to retain a clear representation of the information.
